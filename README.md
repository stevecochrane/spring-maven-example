# spring-maven-example

I'm trying to get more familiar with Java, Spring, and Maven, so here are the results of the 
[Building Java Projects with Maven](http://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) guide. Nothing fancy or original here.

### Instructions

Here's how to run this thing, assuming you have Maven installed:

```bash
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/gs-maven-0.1.0.jar
The current local time is: xx:xx:xx
Hello world!
```
